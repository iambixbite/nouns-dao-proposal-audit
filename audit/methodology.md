# Audit Methodology

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology used by the Nouns DAO Treasury Recovery Initiative to audit past proposals, assess deliverables, and determine appropriate recovery actions. The audit process is designed to be thorough, fair, and transparent, ensuring that all Nouns DAO proposals are evaluated using consistent criteria.

## Audit Process

### 1. Data Collection

For each proposal (#1-763), we collect the following data points:

- **On-chain Data**: 
  - Proposal transaction details
  - Voting results
  - Treasury fund transfers
  - Wallet addresses involved

- **Off-chain Documentation**:
  - Proposal descriptions and specifications
  - Forum discussions and amendments
  - Discord communications
  - Public updates and progress reports
  - Social media announcements related to the proposal

- **Deliverable Evidence**:
  - Websites, applications, and digital products
  - Physical products and merchandise
  - Events and community activities
  - Creative works and content
  - Code repositories and technical implementations

### 2. Deliverable Analysis

Each proposal is analyzed based on the explicit promises made in the proposal. We extract:

- **Specific Deliverables**: Tangible outputs explicitly promised
- **Timeline Commitments**: Dates or timeframes for completion
- **Success Metrics**: Any measurable criteria for success
- **Budget Allocations**: How funds were designated to be used

For each deliverable, we determine:
- Was it completed as specified?
- Was it completed within the promised timeframe?
- Does it meet the quality standards described in the proposal?
- Is there verifiable evidence of completion?

### 3. Status Classification

Based on our analysis, each proposal is classified into one of the following categories:

- **✅ COMPLETED**: 
  - All promised deliverables were provided as specified
  - Timeline was reasonably adhered to (or delays were properly communicated and accepted)
  - Quality meets or exceeds expectations set in the proposal

- **⚠️ PARTIAL**: 
  - Some deliverables were completed as promised
  - Some deliverables remain outstanding
  - Project may still be in progress but significantly behind schedule
  - Communication has been maintained but inadequate

- **⏳ DELAYED**: 
  - Few or no deliverables completed
  - Project is significantly behind schedule
  - Minimal progress demonstrated
  - Funds remain in proposer's wallet/control
  - Some communication exists but is infrequent or inadequate

- **❌ RUGGED**: 
  - Few or no deliverables completed
  - Minimal or no progress demonstrated
  - Minimal or no communication from proposer
  - Funds have been withdrawn or are unaccounted for
  - Proposer appears to have abandoned the project

### 4. Financial Assessment

For each proposal, we calculate:

- **Total Funds Allocated**: The ETH and USD value at time of funding
- **Estimated Completion Percentage**: Based on deliverables completed
- **Value Delivered**: Estimated value of completed work
- **Outstanding Value**: Estimated value of uncompleted work
- **Recovery Target**: Amount that should reasonably be returned to the DAO

### 5. Jurisdictional Research

For proposals classified as PARTIAL, DELAYED, or RUGGED:

- Identify the legal jurisdiction of the proposer
- Research applicable contract and fraud laws
- Assess the feasibility of legal recovery
- Prioritize cases based on recovery potential and jurisdiction

### 6. Documentation Standards

All audit findings are documented using:

- Standardized templates
- Evidence-based assertions
- Direct quotes from original proposals
- Screenshots and archives of relevant materials
- Blockchain transaction records
- Timeline of communications and events

## Quality Control Measures

To ensure accuracy and fairness:

1. **Multiple Reviewers**: Each proposal assessment is reviewed by at least two team members
2. **Community Input**: Preliminary findings are shared with the community for feedback
3. **Proposer Outreach**: When possible, proposers are contacted to provide additional evidence
4. **Legal Review**: Classifications that may lead to legal action are reviewed by legal counsel
5. **Transparent Updates**: All methodological decisions are documented and shared with the community

## Ethical Considerations

The audit team adheres to the following principles:

- **Presumption of Good Faith**: We assume proposers intended to deliver unless evidence suggests otherwise
- **Fair Assessment**: We consider extenuating circumstances and market conditions
- **Balanced Reporting**: We document both successes and failures
- **Proportional Response**: Recovery efforts are proportional to the severity of non-delivery
- **Privacy Respect**: Personal information is handled according to applicable laws

## Timeline and Updates

The audit methodology may be refined as the initiative progresses. Any significant changes will be:
- Documented in this methodology document
- Announced to the Nouns DAO community
- Applied consistently to remaining proposals

## Appeal Process

Proposers who disagree with their classification may appeal by:
1. Submitting additional evidence of deliverables
2. Providing explanation for delays or changes
3. Demonstrating continued work on the project

Appeals will be reviewed by the audit team and legal counsel before any final determination is made.

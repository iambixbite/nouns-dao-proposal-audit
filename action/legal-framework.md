# Legal Framework for Nouns DAO Treasury Recovery

## Overview

This document outlines the legal framework and approach used by the Nouns DAO Treasury Recovery Initiative to recover funds from proposals that failed to deliver on promised outcomes. All recovery efforts are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and with the primary goal of returning misappropriated treasury funds to the DAO.

## Legal Basis for Recovery

The Treasury Recovery Initiative operates on the following legal principles:

### 1. Contractual Obligation

Nouns DAO proposals constitute legally binding contracts when:
- The proposer offers specific deliverables in exchange for funding
- The DAO accepts this offer by voting to approve the proposal
- Consideration is exchanged (funds transferred to proposer)
- There is clear intent to enter into a legally binding agreement

When a proposer fails to deliver on promised outcomes after receiving funds, this constitutes a **breach of contract**.

### 2. Fiduciary Responsibility

Proposers who receive DAO funds have a fiduciary responsibility to:
- Use the funds for the stated purpose
- Act in good faith
- Provide the promised deliverables
- Communicate significant delays or obstacles
- Return unused or misappropriated funds

### 3. Unjust Enrichment

In cases where proposers receive treasury funds but deliver little to no value, they may be liable under the doctrine of unjust enrichment, which holds that:
- One party cannot be enriched at the expense of another
- When one party receives a benefit that would be unjust to retain, they must make restitution

## Recovery Process

The recovery process follows a graduated approach, escalating only as necessary:

### Stage 1: Initial Outreach

For proposals classified as PARTIAL, DELAYED, or RUGGED:

1. **Informal Communication**
   - Email, Discord, or other accessible channels
   - Clear statement of unfulfilled obligations
   - Request for project status update
   - Opportunity to present evidence of progress
   - Timeline for response (typically 7-14 days)

### Stage 2: Formal Notice

If initial outreach receives no response or inadequate explanation:

1. **Formal Notice of Breach**
   - Sent via email and, when possible, certified mail
   - Clear itemization of unfulfilled deliverables
   - Reference to specific proposal terms that were breached
   - Evidence of funds received
   - Request for compliance or return of funds
   - Timeline for response (typically 14-30 days)

2. **Notice of Intent to Pursue Recovery**
   - Clear statement of intent to pursue legal action
   - Final opportunity to remedy the breach
   - Proposal of potential settlement options
   - Timeline for response (typically 7-14 days)

### Stage 3: Legal Action

If formal notices fail to produce resolution:

1. **Demand Letter from Legal Counsel**
   - Formal legal letterhead
   - Comprehensive statement of legal claims
   - Calculation of damages/recovery amount
   - Clear deadline for response
   - Statement of intent to pursue available legal remedies

2. **Alternative Dispute Resolution**
   - Offer of mediation or arbitration
   - Reference to any dispute resolution mechanisms in the proposal

3. **Litigation**
   - Filing of complaint in appropriate jurisdiction
   - Pursuit of available legal remedies
   - Enforcement of judgment

## Types of Legal Notices

The initiative employs several types of legal notices depending on the circumstances:

### 1. Request for Project Update

**Purpose**: To establish current status and give benefit of doubt
**Used when**: Project appears delayed but communication has been maintained
**Key elements**:
- Friendly but firm tone
- Request for specific progress updates
- Offer of assistance or accommodation if reasonable
- Reminder of deliverable commitments

### 2. Notice of Breach of Contract

**Purpose**: To formally establish breach of contractual obligations
**Used when**: Clear evidence of significant unfulfilled deliverables
**Key elements**:
- Formal notification of specific breaches
- Reference to proposal terms as contractual obligations
- Request for cure within specific timeframe
- Statement of potential consequences

### 3. Clawback Notice

**Purpose**: To recover funds due to substantial non-delivery
**Used when**: Little to no deliverables despite significant funding
**Key elements**:
- Formal demand for return of funds
- Specific calculation of amount to be returned
- Legal basis for clawback
- Timeline and method for fund return
- Consequences of non-compliance

### 4. Settlement Offer

**Purpose**: To reach efficient resolution without extended legal process
**Used when**: Some delivery has occurred or proposer acknowledges issue
**Key elements**:
- Acknowledgment of partial completion (if applicable)
- Proposed settlement amount
- Release terms
- Timeline for acceptance
- Consequences of rejection

## Jurisdictional Considerations

The legal approach is tailored based on:

1. **Proposer Jurisdiction**:
   - US-based proposers: Emphasis on contract law and potential small claims court
   - International proposers: Consideration of international private law and jurisdictional challenges
   - Anonymous proposers: Focus on blockchain-based recovery methods where possible

2. **Amount at Stake**:
   - High-value recovery: Full legal proceedings may be economically justified
   - Lower-value recovery: Focus on efficient resolution through demand letters and settlement

3. **Evidence Quality**:
   - Clear documentation: Stronger legal position for recovery
   - Limited documentation: More emphasis on negotiation and settlement

## Ethical Guidelines

All recovery efforts adhere to the following ethical guidelines:

1. **Proportionality**: Legal efforts are proportional to the amount at stake and degree of breach
2. **Good Faith**: Assumption of good faith unless clear evidence to the contrary
3. **Transparency**: All recovery efforts are documented and reported to the DAO
4. **No Harassment**: Strict prohibition against harassment, threats, or doxing
5. **Privacy**: Respect for applicable privacy laws and regulations
6. **Due Process**: Opportunity for proposers to explain or remedy breaches

## Legal Disclaimers

1. This framework is not legal advice and should not be construed as such.
2. The specific legal approach for each case will be determined in consultation with qualified legal counsel.
3. Laws vary by jurisdiction and may affect the viability of specific recovery strategies.
4. The Nouns DAO Treasury Recovery Initiative reserves the right to modify this framework as necessary.

## Recovery Documentation

All recovery efforts are documented using standardized templates to ensure:
- Consistency in approach
- Clear record of all communications
- Evidence preservation
- Compliance with legal and ethical standards
- Transparency for the DAO community

## Conclusion

This legal framework provides a structured, ethical, and legally sound approach to recovering Nouns DAO treasury funds from proposals that failed to deliver promised outcomes. By following this graduated process, the initiative aims to maximize recovery while maintaining the DAO's reputation and adhering to legal and ethical standards.
